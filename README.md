# The_Big_Bang_Theory_Text_Adventure_Game

Introduction: 
This game is a reiteration of a scene from my favorite TV 
Show, The Big Bang Theory! In this particular scene we can see the protagonist 
Sheldon Cooper come across a retro text based computer game from the 1980s.
I plan to replicate the scenario as best I can using Python.
The game in the show allows for any inputs from the player but I will try to
make the inputs fairly simple for this particular assignment.

Please watch this video to view the scene of the show I am refrencing:
